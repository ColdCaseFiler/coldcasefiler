# Cold Case Filer

A cold case file web utility.

## What is it?

Cold Case Filer is a Github pages template designed to help organize, link and display information in cold cases.

It is free to use and customize for any case of your choosing.

## Why did you make this?

Well, <a href="https://github.com/qwtel">qwtel</a> did a lot of the heavy lifting, this is based on his <a href="https://github.com/hydecorp/hydejack">Hydejack</a> template, which is designed to be a blog/project showcase, which I have simply extended.

I discussed my intended use for his template, he agreed, and I started customizing.

I made this because, often, when reading about a cold case it will make me feel like getting out pen and paper to be able to keep track of every name, relation, detail etc. There seem to be so many cases that have a great deal of information available, but seem to be lacking that key detail or perspective that prevent them from being solved. I thought this template might be able to help people catalogue the information that's available to them, and, hopefully, provide a fresh perspective.

## How do you use this?

You'll need a Github account (free).

Once you're setup with that, you can come back to this page and hit the fork button:

Then, when it asks you what to name it, call it: yourusername.github.io 

(where yourusername is whatever Github username you chose. My username is coldcasefiler, so my repo is called: coldcasefiler.github.io)

Now you've got your own site, and you can begin customizing it!

### config.yml

This is where the basic info for your site is located, you will want to change the title, description, tagline, keywords and logo to be that of your case.

### index.md

This is the landing page/main page for the site. It will be the first page people see, and the page that they are taken back to when they click the site logo.

I have used this as a case brief, a summary, an overview of the entirety of the investigation, with clickable links that take you to more detailed pages.
