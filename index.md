## The Murder of John Doe

[John Doe](/people/john-doe/) left work on April 15, 1990 shortly after 5pm. Witnesses reported seeing him approximately half an hour later. There are no credible reports of his whereabouts after this time.

2 months later, a body is recovered from a drainage ditch on the western edge of Doetown. Dental records identify the body as that of [John Doe](/people/john-doe/).

### The Investigation

Early on, the investigation focused on [Jim Davies](/people/jim-davies/), an acquaintance of John's with a prior record of violent assault. Police were initially unable to confirm Davies' alibi, though, in subsequent weeks he would be cleared via surveillance footage obtained from a business across town.

After the clearing of Davies the investigation stalled, with some detectives believing that John may have taken his own life, a theory with which the family strongly disagreed, while others, still suspicious of Davies, began to look into his associates.
